## About Me

I'm a passionate engineer who designs robust, high-performance systems. I was honored to architect Türkiye’s first telco-grade DPI engine—processing traffic for millions daily with sub-1μs latency. I thrive on challenges in high-performance systems programming, resilient architecture, and quality-driven open-source contributions. 🚀

## Skills & Expertise

- **Advanced C++ (17/20/23) & Systems Programming** ⚙️
- **Asynchronous Networking & Low-Latency Solutions** ⚡
- **Python, CI/CD, Virtualization, and Debugging** 🔍
- **Scalable & Resilient Architectural Design** 🏗️

## Selected Contributions

- **Multipass**: Contributor at Canonical, enhancing virtualization solutions across Windows, Linux, and macOS. 🖥️
- **tdslite &amp; Nexus**: Created innovative, lightweight C++ libraries that push performance boundaries. 📈
- **Publication**: Co-author of *CMake Best Practices* and contributed to advanced CMake methods. 📚

## Interests

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me enjoying role-playing games 🎮, perfecting homebrew recipes 🍺, hitting the gravel trails 🚴, or even exploring indie MMORPG design! 🎲
