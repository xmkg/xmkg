## About Me

I write systems software—currently virtualization tooling at Canonical. Co-wrote a book on CMake, once built a DPI engine that ran under a microsecond, and I'm building an MMORPG with UE5 in my free time.

## Interests

RPGs, homebrewing, gravel cycling, and tinkering with an indie MMORPG.
